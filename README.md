### Fix error with state
### udpate react redux to 8, and fix startup error
redux-persist failed to create sync storage. falling back to noop storage.
problem with action { type: '@@redux/INITr.o.o.s.s' }

Also store state in local storage

// TODO: endAdornment with if else condtional instead of state

Keep in mind, the state variables are built. I just need the upgrade, and some modifications to the files.

Also, cleanup to stop the state from running a bunch of times

Hello there. I need some help with a blitz/next js website.   Mostly minor UI things that have to do with material UI and connecting it to the database.

Such as drag drop.

Most of the work is done.  I just need someone to finish the mutations.

I will point you directly to the code, and it should be very easy.
